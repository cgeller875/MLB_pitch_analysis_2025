## __Best Active Pitch: Mason Miller’s Slider__

### __Methods:__ 
Mason Miller’s slider stands out as the most dominant pitch in baseball today. Using Baseball Savant’s 2025 Pitch Arsenal Stats Leaderboard, I analyzed every pitch thrown at least 406 times (Baseball Savant’s qualifier) in 2025. To evaluate overall performance, I ranked each pitch across key outcome metrics — Run Value, RV/100, Batting Average (BA), Slugging Percentage (SLG), Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA), Strikeout Percentage (K%), Put-Away Percentage, and their expected and hard-hit variants — using Excel’s RANK.EQ function. Each statistic’s leader received a rank of one, and I summed each pitch’s ranks across all metrics. The pitch with the lowest total ranking represented the best overall performance, which I identified using XLOOKUP.
Miller’s slider consistently ranked among the league’s elite: 1st in RV/100, Batting Average, Slugging Percentage, wOBA, and Put-Away Percentage; 3rd in Strikeout Rate, Expected Slugging, and Expected wOBA; and 8th in Expected Batting Average. Even its weakest category, Hard-Hit Percentage (20th), remained well above average.
This data-driven approach suggests Miller’s slider is not only statistically dominant but also the most consistently effective pitch in 2025. Its notable velocity and late break generate both swing-and-miss and weak contact, aligning the metrics with observable performance. Further research could explore how these pitch-level statistics correlate with overall pitcher success, but by any measure, Mason Miller’s slider defines the modern gold standard for pitching excellence.
